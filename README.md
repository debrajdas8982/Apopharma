Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

We have created the web application Apotek Pharma. Apotek Pharma is aimed primarily at pharmacists. Here you as a pharmacist will have the opportunity to scan prescriptions, create prescription QR code, access messages and submit feedback and support forms and be inspired by others with the same burning interest in pharmacy. A web application that inspires you to develop a solution for pharmacist results at pharmacy.

## Main functionalities
1. Scan Prescription Qr Code
2. Inbox (where a pharmacisit can see upcoming messages and notifications)
3. Feedback (Here a pharmacist can send a feedback about the website)
4. Support (A pharmacist can ask for a support)

## Run the website
We have created a node.js file called (server.js) which needs to run simultaneously in the terminal to run the login.js which will authorize to enter into the website
